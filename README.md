# Book Management CRUD Application

## Overview
This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application is designed to manage a collection of books. Developed using Java and Spring Boot, the application allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on book data. The RESTful API endpoints are tested and managed using Postman.

## Features
- **Add Books:** Add new books to the collection.
- **View Books:** Retrieve details of all books or a specific book by its ID.
- **Update Books:** Modify the details of an existing book.
- **Delete Books:** Remove a book from the collection.

## Project Structure
- **Book Repository:** Handles all database interactions related to book data.
- **Book Controller:** Contains RESTful API endpoints for managing book-related operations.
- **Book Model:** Defines the data structure for book information, including title, author, publication date, and ISBN.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Postman (for testing APIs)
- A SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-management-crud-app.git
   cd book-management-crud-app
   ```

2. **Configure the database:**
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your database configuration.
   
3. **Build the project:**
   - Using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - Using Gradle:
     ```bash
     gradle build
     ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/book-management-crud-app.jar
   ```

5. **Test the APIs:**
   - Use Postman to test the available RESTful API endpoints.
   - The API documentation can be accessed via `/swagger-ui.html` after starting the application.

## Usage
